# Stomata!

## Description
Science out-reach game. You take control of the stomata (variable-width pores) on the surface of a leaf. Stomata allow gaseous exchange for photosynthesis. However they also constitute a major entry point for pathogens (particularly fungus). Therefore your aim is to keep your stomata open as much as possible in the sunlight (for photosynthesis and points!) and to close them when pathogens get near.

## Game Rules
* Points trickle in for each open stomata if it is light.
* Close/open stomata by clicking on them.
* Pathogens rain down from the sky and try to attack the stomata.
* Try to get as many points as possible in a minute!
